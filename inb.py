Here are secure alternatives to WhatsApp for transactions on your site:

Integrated Messaging System:
Build a private messaging/chat feature so buyers and sellers can communicate directly on your platform. This keeps all communication in-app and can be monitored for fraud.

Order/Checkout System:
Implement an order/cart system where buyers can place orders directly on the site. Sellers get notified and can accept/reject orders.

Escrow Payment Integration:
Use a payment gateway (e.g., Paystack, Stripe, PayPal) with escrow functionality. Funds are held until the buyer confirms receipt of goods/services, reducing fraud risk.

User Reviews & Ratings:
Allow buyers to rate sellers and leave feedback. This builds trust and helps identify bad actors.

Verified Sellers:
Require sellers to verify their identity (e.g., upload ID, business documents) before listing products.

Dispute Resolution:
Add a dispute system so buyers/sellers can report issues, and admins can mediate.

Recommended next step:
Start with an integrated messaging system and order/checkout flow, then add payment integration and reviews.
